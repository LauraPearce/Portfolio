**TO SEE A COMPLETE PROJECT SHOWCASING EVERYTHING I HAVE LEARNT SEE NAILSBYNIKKI & NAILSBYNIKKI.TEST**

**Otherwise, please read the descriptions for each project to understand what I was trying to achieve / learn as a number of projects can be improved using techniques I learnt later.**

This repository contains a number of personal projects designed to demonstrate my coding proficiency to prospective employers and denote my progress. Early commit history is missing from GitHub because the repository has been migrated from a private Azure DevOps project, however this can be provided upon request.

# Projects
## C# Fundamentals
**ConsoleForTesting**

>*Console app designed to run and test code in other projects. Done this way to learn about decoupling, seperation of concerns & reusability. For most projects this could be replaced with dedicated unit test projects where it is being used for testing (like ProgrammingChallenges) or dedicated applications where there should be a console app (like Battleships).*
 
 **ProgrammingChallenges**
 
  >*Class library containing a number of static methods to demonstrate understanding of basic programming concepts and C# syntax / best practises.*
  
 **BattleshipsLibrary**
 
 >*Class library to support a fully functional version of the game battleships (without the use of OOP). Console app dependant code can be found under Console App for testing in the BattleshipConsole class. A complete console app version of the game can be run from there as well. The project is to demonstrate advanced understanding of programming concepts by applying them together in a complexed procedural program.*
 
## Object-Orientated Programming
 **OOPChallenges**
 
 >*Class library containing 2 basic examples of how to implement OOP including all of it's 4 main principles.*
 
 **Poker**
 
 >*This is still in progress. Class library to support a game of Poker (decoupled from any specific front-end). This project is designed to demonstrate understanding of how to appropriately apply OOP concepts to a more complex set of requirements.*
 
## .NET Core, Web APIs & Unit Testing (Mocking used in NailsByNikki)
 **CodingChallenges**
 
>*This is a rewrite of our earlier ProgrammingChallenges project from the C# Fundamentals section but as a web API. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of .NET Core applications, web APIs and how we create them.*

 **CodingChallenges.Test**
 >*This is the unit test project for the CodingChallenges web API. This project demonstrates basic understanding of how to write units and setup a test project.*
 
## Databases (EF Core used in NailsByNikki)
 **Northwind Questions**
 
>*Demonstrates understanding of how to write a range of basic and complex SQL queries against the example Northwind database as provided by Microsoft. Also includes how to insert, update and delete records.*

 **LaurasCodingSchool**
 
 >*This contains a create script for a relational database for a School. The purpose of this task is demonstrate understanding of relational database design concepts and how to appropriately apply them to met a set of requirements.*
 
## Final Project (NailsByNikki)
 **NailsByNikki**
 
 >*NailsByNikki is a real life scenario where I am to creating a booking system for my sisters nail business. Having a real life scenario has provided me with experience of requirements gathering and meant I have to design and implement a full backend API without specific supporting examples. The project contains a Web API, EF Core (code-first) relational database using migrations, Unit Testing and Integration Testing.*
	 
**NailsByNikki.Test**

 >*This is the test project for NailsByNikki. This project contains both unit and integration tests and also demonstrates the appropriate use of the repository pattern and mocking (Moq).*
