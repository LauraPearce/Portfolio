Exercise 2
----------

I am developer working on a number of applications for a school that I am thinking about reusing and taking to other schools.

I want a library that I can use to manage the student and teaching groups.

Students must have a name and be able to set a latest test score. Test scores should be between 1-100.

Teaching groups should have students. I should be able to get the student with the highest score and lowest scores and the average score for the group.
